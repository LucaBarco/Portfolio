/** 
 *
 * Created by softeng on 27/4/2020.
 *
 * Update V2 :
 * 1) issue 1 		--->		Premium diesel has been added to the list of selectable fuel types in the front-end.
 * 								Back-end side GasStationDto, GasStation, GasStationRepository and the APIs have been
 * 								updated coherently.
 * 2) issue 6 		--->		Update of the APIs "getGasStationsByProximity" and "getGasStationsWithCoordinates" to
 * 								support the customization of the search radius. The parameter "myRadius" is thought to be
 * 								considered as an INTEGER number of kilometers. If it is set to an invalid value (zero or
 * 								negative) it should be ignored and the default value (1km should be considered).
 * 3) issue 16/CR7  --->		The lack of a gasStation fuel price now is equivalent to null and not to -1. Dtos
 * 								don't use primitive double type anymore, they use Double class. GasStationDto and
 * 								GasStation entity have been updated coherently.
 * 							    PS To achieve a "softer" migration from V1 to V2 the "setReport" API has almost the same
 * 							    prototype even though the controller is receiving a new Dto for the price report.
 * 4) issue 22/23	--->		InvalidCarSharingException has been added to support a better error handling.
 * 								If the GasStationDto (sent as parameter of saveGasStation) has a non existing or an
 * 								invalid id this should be seen as a registration of a new GasStation, thus no
 * 								InvalidGasStationException should be thrown.
 *								DeleteGasStation throws an exception if an invalid (negative) id is used as parameter.
 *								If instead a non existing id is used as parameter the API should return false.
