# Project risks

###

|  Risk type (technical, project, business) | Risk description | Probability (high, medium, low) | Impact (high, medium, low)|
| ------ | ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| project | *user base*: given the nature of the app (ie. crowdsourcing) a big active user base is needed in order to make it work effectively. The more the users, the more accurate the info inside the app, the more it would be appreciated. The lack of such large user base might be a big risk. | high | high |
| technical | *hacker attacks*: a group of hackers could overload the application with a lot of fake accounts, fake gas stations, fake prices. The hackers may also attack the application in order to steal sensible data.   | high | high |
| business | *initial requirements breakdown*: the investor who decided to fund the project, starts asking for modifications and implementations (ie. introduces new requirements). These new requirements might go in a radically different direction with respect to the original ones; this might cause several inconsistencies through the project and might even require to redo the whole requirements and design process from skratch. This would take a lot of time away from implementing new features, the ones actually useful for the success of the app. We "couldn't" say "*no*" to the investor (after all he's paying us!) but some structural changes the core of the project would be needed first in order to implement the new features requested. Since the investor wouldn't see those changes "under the hood", he could think of our team as very unproductive and inefficient, causing a "short circuit" in the developers-founder relationship. | high | medium |
| project | *under estimations*: since this is a young start-up, without any history about previous software products, the estimations of the project might be completely wrong. This would case delays in the delivery of the final product, falling short on economical resources and time. | high | low |
| project | *lack of feedback from end-users*: the app might be a complete failure on the UI point of view (ie. not intuitive) or might not include the functionalities the users would use the most (ie. not useful). The users might start not using the app witout the developers knowing why; an efficient way to collect feedback would be really needed | medium | low |
| techincal | *GDPR changes*: the terms of use guaranteed by GDPR about user's sensible data may change over time and this may cause a different management  of users' sensible data with respect to  the current one in the application. | medium | medium | 
| technical |*Support for OpenStreetMaps REST APIs*: the REST APIs provided by OpenStreetMap may change in every moment (for example in terms of authorization mechanism or requests format). This situation may cause a complete redesign of the interaction between EzGas and OpenStreetMaps |medium | high|
| business | *agreements on global warming*: the world leaders acknowledge the stunning increase in temperature all over the world. Since according the scientists, this is mainly due to the fossil-fuels powered engines, they come to an agreement about a law that would forbid the use of any fossil-fuel powered engine (ie. cars, motorbikes,...). Such a law would mean the end for the ezgas project. | low | high|
| technical | *team members turnover*: since this is a very new and young start-up, some members of the team may not find it very helpful or stimulating for their carriers. Therefore, they might leave anytime and these frequently changes in personell, could lead to "frictions" in the developement process and cause time losses (ie. unproductivity). | low | medium |
